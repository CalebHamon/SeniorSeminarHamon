Put everyone and their choices into an array list, go down by order of who signed up first to get their first choice, then go by first choice, second choice, etc.
Ensure that no one is double scheduled, even the alumni.
Have a system to check if this is the most optimal schedule (searching if the max amount of people have their first choice) and changing it if it is not optimal.

Jan 18 - Today I got the roster with the name. email and choice with each other. Additionally updated the txt files. 
For next class - Want to rank classes via popularity to then begin to sort classes by which is most popular to give an optimal schedule

Jan 22 - Today I created a sessions Arraylist to keep track of each sessions and its popularity score. I also updated the tester so now the rosters properly load
For next class - create popularity scores, make sure it is dynamic

Jan 26 - Today I got the popularity score to be more efficent + trying to get the time slots working by adding an array list (so far got setter) that carries what classes are where
For next class - Get the time slot array list to work + start alloting classes to them, making sure students and alums are not double booked 

Jan 30 - Today I got the pop score to work when it needs to remove people already in a class, and got the adding classmates to work
For next class - continuing adding people to the classes and make the entire schedule
