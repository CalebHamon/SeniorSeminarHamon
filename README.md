Put everyone and their choices into an array list, go down by order of who signed up first to get their first choice, then go by first choice, second choice, etc.
Ensure that no one is double scheduled, even the alumni.
Have a system to check if this is the most optimal schedule (searching if the max amount of people have their first choice) and changing it if it is not optimal.
